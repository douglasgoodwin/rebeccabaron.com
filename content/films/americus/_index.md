# In the film installation “Poverty Housing. Americus, Georgia” film-maker Rebecca Baron and artist Dorit Margreiter address the subject of the reenactment and display of poverty as in the case of the “Global Village Discovery Center” in Americus, Georgia (USA), which contains a replica of an existing South African slum. The theme park which is operated by a non-profit association serves to raise money for the association’s social activities through the graphic visualization of poverty.
