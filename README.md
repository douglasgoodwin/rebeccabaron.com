This project has been pre-configured to work with [Forestry](https://forestry.io) a git-based CMS, [import this starter in Forestry](https://app.forestry.io/quick-start?repo=forestryio/hugo-ananke-forestry&engine=hugo&version=0.81.0) to be able to edit and preview your site âœ¨.

Any changes you make in Forestry will be committed back to the Git repository. Deploy your site on [Vercel](#vercel) or [Netlify](#netlify) within minutes.

## Deployment

### Netlify

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/douglasgoodwin/rebeccabaron.com)

1. Set the build command to: `hugo --gc --minify`
1. Make sure to set `HUGO_VERSION` to 0.65.0 or above (tested with latest version)
1. Set the publish directory to: `public`

That's it, now your site gets deployed automatically on `git push` or when saving documents from Forestry.

## Local development

This starter is using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) as a static site generator.
